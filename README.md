## Calculator Project
This is a simple Python project that includes a Calculator class and a suite of unit tests to verify its functionality.

### Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website.

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-project.git```

### Usage
To use the Calculator class, you can import it into your Python code as follows:

```
from calculator import Calculator

# create a new instance of the Calculator class
c = Calculator()

# use the calculator's methods to perform calculations
result = c.add(2, 3)
print(result) # output: 5

result = c.subtract(5, 2)
print(result) # output: 3
```

The Calculator class includes the following methods:

- `add(a, b)`: returns the sum of  `a` and `b`
- `subtract(a, b)`: returns the difference between `a` and `b`
- `multiply(a, b)`: returns the product of `a` and `b`
- `divide(a, b)`: returns the quotient of `a` and `b`
The `divide` method `raises` a ValueError if the second argument (`b`) is zero.

### Running the Tests
To run the unit tests for this project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```python -m unittest discover ```
This will run all of the unit tests defined in the test_calculator.py file and output the results to the console.
